There are two macros in this workbook. The first is 'summarizeStocks', which performs the full summary of the table, finding change per ticker in the year and finding the largest changes. 

The second macro is 'clearSheets', which resets each sheet to wipe away the summary and formatting to enable a clean rerun of the 'summarizeStocks' macro.
